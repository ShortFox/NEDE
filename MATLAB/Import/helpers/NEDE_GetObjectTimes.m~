function [object_nums,object_times] = NEDE_GetObjectTimes(visible, maxFrameTime)

% INPUT object_limits is an nx6 matrix, where n is the number of frames in
% which an object was visible.  It is the output of get_objectlimits.m.
% OUTPUT object_times is an mx2 matrix, where m is the number of frames in
% which an object entered or exited the scene.
